You were convicted of a misdemeanor or felony offense. You successfully completed probation; and. You are not currently charged with another criminal offense, on probation or serving a sentence for a criminal conviction. The completion of probation requirement is a key aspect for an expungement.

Unfortunately, news of innocent bystanders being arrested, injured, or killed by police officers for being in the wrong place at the wrong time has increasingly become too common. Men and women in uniform must follow a code of conduct. When they fail to do so, their governing agency may be liable for any resulting injuries or death. If you or a loved one has been injured or has died because of excessive police force, brutality or shooting, the aggressive Los Angeles civil rights attorneys at the Law Offices of Simon M. Aval have the knowledge and experience to help you seek justice. No amount of monetary compensation we can get you will undo the harm caused. But it can help you get the closure you need. The Types of Police Brutality Claims We Handle Our legal team believes that no one is above accountability when causing injury to an innocent party. Over the years, we have seen and handled police brutality and misconduct claims involving. Police shootings. Guns should be used as a last resort in law enforcement. When police officers purposely or recklessly commit an unjustified shooting, they tear families apart and cause tragic hardships for the victim. When these highly controversial incidents happen, our Los Angeles police shooting attorneys aggressively pursue personal injury or wrongful death compensation for the victim or the victim's loved ones. Excessive use of force. A badge does not allow law enforcement the right to violate an individual's civil rights with excessive use of force. The police have a legal obligation to only use that amount of force that is reasonably necessary to achieve proper goals. False arrests. In most cases, law enforcement must have probable cause to arrest someone they take into custody. When an arrest is based on the officer falsely using his position, he or she is acting outside the scope of the law and they can be held liable. False imprisonment. Similarly, police officers do not have a right to hold an individual against their will without proper justification. This is called false imprisonment. Victims may be entitled to compensation. Unnecessary use of tasers. Tasers are an effective weapon, allowing police officers to exercise physical control over an individual without having to use a weapon. Sexual harassment. Just like others, police officers can be held responsible if they use their authority to harass individuals within the community. Victims of sexual harassment at the hands of law enforcement are left feeling even more vulnerable, unprotected, and violated. Our aggressive Los Angeles civil rights attorneys have the knowledge and experience to aggressively pursue compensation from law enforcement agencies at the local, state, and federal level when unjust police actions leave you or your loved ones seriously injured. The legal restrictions on these types of claims make these cases challenging to pursue. However, with our proven track record, victims of police misconduct can be confident that their cases will be handled with a full commitment to a positive outcome. Important Steps to Take If You Were the Victim of Police Misconduct If you believe that you or someone you care about has been the victim of any type of police misconduct, it is important to note that the steps you take in the aftermath can impact the outcome of your case. One of the most important steps to take is to protect yourself. However, it is also important to comply with the police officer's requests as best as possible in a non-aggressive manner. Although this may not always be a deterrent to police brutality or misconduct, it can significantly reduce your risk of injury or death. Once the incident is over, you need to immediately seek medical care and attention. You must also contact an experienced Los Angeles civil rights and police brutality attorney to help protect your legal rights and seek the just compensation that you deserve. How Our Los Angeles Civil Rights & Police Misconduct Attorneys Can Help If you believe that your civil rights have been violated at the hands of a law enforcement agency, the experienced legal team at the Law Offices of Simon M.

{"company_id": 397793, "page_url": "https://www.simonaval.com/category/criminal-defense/", "company_name": "Simon Aval, Attorney At Law, A Law Corporation", "text": "California law defines Assault With a Deadly Weapon (ADW) as an assault on another individual committed with a deadly weapon or with a force that is likely to result in serious bodily harm. The penalties associated with an ADW charge can be serious and can significantly affect all aspects of your life. If you or a loved one has been charged with an Assault With a Deadly Weapon, it is imperative that you immediately consult an experienced Los Angeles criminal defense attorney to protect your legal rights. Defining \"Deadly Weapon\". Despite what most Californians think, you do not need to possess a \"deadly weapon\" in order to be arrested for ADW. In fact, most people are shocked as to how they can possibly be charged with this crime when they had no weapon. The truth is that something as seemingly innocent as a bottle can be considered a weapon. The law defines a \"deadly weapon\" as any object that can cause serious bodily harm or death. So, using the example of the bottle, if you hit another person hard enough on the head with a bottle, it can cause serious injuries. The District Attorney can charge you with ADW, alleging the bottle was the deadly weapon. Consequences of ADW Charges. An assault with a deadly weapon is known as a \"wobbler\" because the prosecutor has the option of filing it either as a misdemeanor or a felony, depending upon the circumstances of the crime. In deciding how to file the ADW, the prosecutor will look at three important factors. What type of weapon was allegedly used. Whether the victim sustained injuries. The status of the victim (whether the victim was a police officer, firefighter or any other \"protected\" government individual). Mr. Aval is a Certified Specialist in criminal law by the state bar of California. If you or a loved one has been arrested for allegedly committing a crime, you may be released on bail if certain criteria are met. To ensure that your bail is set at a reasonable amount by the judge, it is in your best interest to immediately contact a Los Angeles criminal defense lawyer. Your attorney can even help you get in touch with a bail bond agency. What Is Bail?. Bail is the means by which a judge permits your release from custody if you have been allegedly charged with a crime by ensuring that you appear at all required court proceedings. Once you are arrested for allegedly committing a crime, you will be taken to a detention facility. Prior to arraignment, you will have an opportunity to hire a Los Angeles criminal defense lawyer and appear before the presiding judge to see if you can be released on bail. Stationhouse Bail. If you have committed a minor offense, the arresting officer has the authority to release you on minimal bail. However, stationhouse bails are not available in all jurisdictions, forcing most individuals to appear in court for a bail hearing. Bail Bond Agencies. If you are unable to meet bail, your attorney can help you contact bail bond agencies to post a cash bail for a set fee. Once you have contacted the right bail bond agency for your circumstances, they can quickly arrange to post bail and have you released from detention. It should be noted that involving a bail bond agency could get expensive. One disadvantage is that you will not get a refund of the substantial fees paid to the agency to post bail. Additionally, you also risk dealing with a bounty hunter who will do everything possible to arrest you if fail to appear in court. The court gives bounty hunters the freedom to arrest a fleeing defendant without process and turn them into the court's custody without any hearing or protection.

Mr. Aval is a Certified Specialist in criminal law by the state bar of California. Getting convicted of a crime can be devastating. In certain situations, a conviction is unavoidable, even if you have hired the most experienced Los Angeles criminal defense attorney. However, a good attorney can make the sentencing process less frightful by getting you prepared for the process and what lies ahead. There are various factors that your criminal defense attorney may take into consideration when preparing your case for sentencing. Place of Incarceration. Where you are sent for incarceration can play a big factor in how your sentence is completed. One of the reasons for this is where you serve your sentence can determine how much security you will be subject to and how much discipline you will face. Additionally, each facility houses inmates convicted for different crimes, thus exposing you to different levels of danger. As such, your Los Angeles criminal defense attorney should ask the judge to assign you to a facility with the lowest security level possible. Self-Reporting. After sentencing, most criminal defense lawyers advise their clients to self-report to prison. If you choose to do so, you will have to pay for your own travel to your assigned prison facility at your own cost and time. This may be worth the cost because it demonstrates to the court that you are trustworthy, which may ultimately lower your inmate security classification. Books and Legal Documents. You will not be allowed to bring any books or legal documents to prison. Your Los Angeles criminal defense attorney can help you arrange to have these items mailed to wherever you will be incarcerated. Visitors. Generally, it is difficult to arrange for visitors while serving a prison sentence. As such, you should ask your attorney to compile a pre-sentence report list of your immediate family members and spouse for an easier visiting process. Call an Experienced Los Angeles Criminal Defense Attorney. Mr. Aval is a Certified Specialist in criminal law by the state bar of California. If are involved in a police investigation regarding allegations of criminal activity, it is important that you are represented by an experienced Los Angeles criminal defense attorney to protect your legal rights and help avoid having formal charges filed against you. 3 Reasons You Need a Criminal Attorney. Below is a discussion of the three most important reasons why you need a criminal attorney on your side during ongoing police investigations. An attorney can act as a witness and prevent the police from abusing your constitutional rights during an investigation. An attorney can ensure that the investigation is not intrusive, making it less likely to result in incriminating evidence. The presence of an attorney can prevent you from incriminating yourself by blurting admissions or falsifying evidence. A police investigation can last for weeks or even months without any new information or contact. Depending on the allegations against you, criminal charges can be filed up to one year or as long as six years after the completion of the investigation. Additionally, since police investigations for certain criminal activities do not have a statute of limitations, charges can be filed 20 or 30 years later. However, if you have an experienced Los Angeles criminal defense attorney on your side, you can be confident that your legal rights are protected and that you are not subject to unfair legal practices. Your Legal Rights When Facing Criminal Charges. If the police investigation leads to criminal charges, you are entitled to certain rights, including. To be represented by an attorney. To have a speedy, public trial. To remain silent. To testify in your own defense. To appeal the denial of a suppression motion. Call an Experienced Los Angeles Criminal Defense Attorney. Mr. Aval is a Certified Specialist in criminal law by the state bar of California. A judge or magistrate sets bail to ensure that the suspect will return to court when ordered to appear. Bail can be made in the form of cash, property, or a bond. The court will keep the bail if the suspect fails to appear in court when ordered. Many factors are taken into consideration when the judge or magistrate determines the amount of bail. This article discusses the four important factors that help set bail. The 4 Important Factors of Setting Bail. The four important and common factors that judges generally consider when setting a defendant's bail include. The amount should be sufficiently high to give reasonable assurance that the suspect will attend all court scheduled appearances and comply with all of the conditions of the set bail. Reviewing the nature of the offense and the circumstances under which the alleged crime was committed. The ability of the suspect to make bail, provided the suspect or his or her criminal defense attorney provides sufficient proof of the funds. The future safety of the victim of the alleged offense and the community as a whole is also a big factor is setting bail. Most importantly, the judge will also consider the suspect's criminal history, employment history, financial assets and ties to the community. Your Criminal Defense Attorney's Role. In advocating your release on bail, your criminal defense attorney will try to convince the judge that. The chances of a conviction are not high. Your reliability and ties in the community make you an unlikely candidate to flee while on bail. The alleged offense is not a serious crime. Mr. Aval is a Certified Specialist in criminal law by the state bar of California. A domestic violence conviction accompanies serious offenses under California law. If you or a loved one has been charged with domestic violence, you should consult with a criminal defense attorney who specializes in domestic violence charges to protect your legal rights and put together the best defense to dismiss the charges against you. Felony v. Misdemeanor. In California, a domestic violence crime can be charged as either a misdemeanor or a felony. This decision is at the discretion of the prosecutor who is assigned to the case. The resulting consequences and penalties will depend on whether the prosecutor decides to charge you with a felony or a misdemeanor domestic violence. While neither charge is good news, a misdemeanor charge certainly accompanies less severe penalties and consequences. Misdemeanor Penalties. Penalties for a misdemeanor domestic violence charge can include. 52 hours of domestic violence counseling. 40 hours of community service. No contact order with the victim. Heavy fines. A maximum of 6 months in jail. Felony Penalties. Penalties for a felony domestic violence charge can include. 52 hours of domestic violence counseling. 40 hours of community service. No contact order with the victim. Heavy fines. A minimum of 3 months up to a maximum of 3 years in prison. Regardless of whether you are charged with a misdemeanor or felony domestic violence, the resulting penalties are harsh and can impact all aspects of your life.

Call an Experienced Los Angeles Domestic Violence Attorney. Mr. Aval is a Certified Specialist in criminal law by the state bar of California. You were arrested, but no charges have been filed. You may think that hiring a criminal defense attorney at this \"pre-filing\" stage or \"investigation\" stage is not necessary. On the contrary, hiring an attorney is very important at this stage because critical decisions are being made about your case. Having the right criminal defense attorney can mean the difference between the District Attorney filing formal charges or the announcement that the case has been dropped against you. What Happens At the \"Pre-Filing\" Stage?. At the \" pre-filing \" stage, the police agency that arrested you needs to do a thorough investigation. Upon the completion of their investigation, your case is turned over to the District Attorney for consideration of filing formal charges. Although some attorneys prefer a \"wait and see\" tactic at this critical stage, the more aggressive criminal defense attorneys take a more proactive approach to prevent the detectives from gaining damaging statements, information and other data about your case. In addition, by hiring the right criminal defense attorney, you can also provide the district attorney with positive information about your side of the story that may tip the district attorney into dropping the case. The bottom line is that it is never too early to hire a good criminal defense attorney to protect your legal rights and prevent the filing of formal charges against you. Call an Experienced Los Angeles Criminal Defense Attorney. Mr. Aval is a Certified Specialist in criminal law by the state bar of California. Below are some important steps you should consider to help your criminal defense attorney. Do not talk to the police. You have the constitutional right to remain silent. While you may think that you have nothing to lose by telling your side of the story, nothing could be more devastating to your case. The only thing you will do by telling your story is to help the police build a stronger case against you. Do not talk to anyone. This means you should not even talk to your parents, spouse, siblings or friends. The best policy is not to talk to anyone about your case except to your lawyer. Tell your attorney the whole truth. Your attorney is only as good as the information you provide him or her. The bottom line is that your attorney needs to know every fact, whether you think it is relevant to your case or damaging. Ask questions when you don't understand. A good criminal defense attorney will never think your questions are stupid. Moreover, attorneys prefer a client who understands what is going on with the case, as opposed to those who don't. Keep in contact with your attorney. It is important that you keep all appointments with your attorney and that you notify your attorney if you move. Call an Experienced Los Angeles Criminal Defense Attorney. Mr. Aval is a Certified Specialist in criminal law by the state bar of California. Being accused and convicted of a sex crime in the State of California can entail serious penalties. One of the most devastating consequences is having to register as a sex offender under the Sex Offender Registration Act. To avoid this life shattering consequence, it is imperative that you immediately consult with a Los Angeles sex crime attorney to protect your legal right and obtain the best defense possible. A good criminal defense attorney, who focuses his practice on sex offenses, will know the most effective defenses to prevent a conviction. Mr. Aval is a Certified Specialist in criminal law by the state bar of California. Being accused of any crime can have serious consequences on all aspects of your life. However, getting accused of committing a crime related to violence can be even more devastating and complicated because these types of crimes may or may not involve actual physical injury. If you or someone you love is accused of committing a violent crime, it is imperative that you quickly consult an experienced Los Angeles violent crime defense attorney to protect your legal rights. What Is a Violent Crime?. A violent crime is a crime in which the accused used or threatened force upon the victim. A violent crime can entail both crimes where the act is the objective, such as a murder, as well as crimes where the violence is the means to the end, such as a burglary. The Collateral Consequences. Accusations of committing a crime of violence can quickly trigger negative consequences that can be devastating to your life. In addition to a prison sentence, being accused or convicted of a violent crime can have personal, professional and social consequences. Common consequences include. Arrest. Restraining orders. Loss of employment. Leverage in child custody cases or business disputes. Most violent crimes are often unfounded allegations that are fabricated to obtain influence and control in another case by the victim. It is not uncommon for the \"victim\" to embellish the facts in his or her favor and paint a picture that is more negative than the actual event. However, regardless of whether the victim is embellishing the facts or telling the truth, once you are arrested, the damage is already done. As such, it is important that you immediately consult an attorney to protect your rights.

Despite what many may think, criminal defense attorneys are deeply committed to protecting the legal rights of their clients and ensuring they get the best possible outcomes. The focus of a criminal trial is for the prosecution to prove you are guilty of committing the crime and for your defense attorney to prove the prosecutor lacks sufficient evidence. So, given this fact, should you admit guilt to your attorney?. Talk to Your Lawyer. The majority of criminal defense attorneys prefer that their client be honest with them about the facts of their case- the good, the bad and the ugly. However, other attorneys prefer that their clients do not discuss guilt. These attorneys will tell you up front that they do not want to know everything. The Ethical Issues. Our legal justice system requires the prosecution to prove an individual is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. This high standard is founded on the principle that it is better for a guilty person to go free than for an innocent person to be wrongly convicted. The bottom line is that admitting guilt will not make your defense attorney offer lesser representation.

{"company_id": 397795, "page_url": "https://www.optimusca.com/musings/where-international-diversification-works", "company_name": "Optimus Capital Advisors, LLC", "text": "Where International Diversification Works. Written By John Gesek. Originally published by Christine Benz in Morningstar. Adding international stock exposure is one of the first steps toward a diversified portfolio. Even minimalist investors usually carve out a portion of their portfolios for non-US stocks as a supplement to domestic stocks and bonds. At this point, however, even committed globalists have to acknowledge that adding non-US equities has detracted from the returns of a US-only portfolio, even as it has modestly reduced risk. In the 2024 Diversification Landscape report that I recently completed with Amy Arnott and Karen Zaya, we found that foreign stocks' correlation with the US market has also increased over the past three years. Whether non-US stocks will fail to earn their keep in the future is an open question, however. As the US market has grown increasingly concentrated in the large-growth square of the Morningstar Style Box, especially in technology stocks, investing in non-US equities provides exposure to sectors that are underrepresented in total US market indexes today. Moreover, developing-markets equities have demonstrated a lower correlation with the US market than the developed markets' correlation, albeit with higher levels of volatility. This suggests that investors venturing overseas should make room for emerging markets as part of their non-US allocations. Recent Performance Trends. Even though diversifying into non-US stocks makes intuitive sense and modestly reduced the standard deviation of a US-only portfolio over the past three-, five-, and 10-year periods, doing so has often detracted from returns for US-based investors. In eight of the 10 calendar years from 2014 through 2023, the Morningstar Global Markets ex-US Index lagged the Morningstar US Market Index. Non-US stocks held up better than US stocks in 2022 amid a bear market induced by the Federal Reserve's aggressive campaign of interest-rate hikes. But that was a modest victory, and short-lived. As mega-cap US technology stocks led the market again in 2023, non-US stock indexes failed to keep up. The Morningstar Global Markets ex-US Index gained about 16% in 2023, compared with a 26% return for its US counterpart. The Morningstar Emerging Markets Index gained 12% in 2023 versus an 18% gain for the Morningstar Developed Markets ex-US Index. Emerging markets also fared worse than developed-markets equities in the 2022 bear market. Although stocks in Latin America have been a bright spot recently, China's economic slowdown has weighed heavily on broad emerging-markets indexes. From a diversification perspective, most international-stock benchmarks, especially those in developed markets, have been closely tied to the US market over the past three years, as shown below. Developed-markets equities, especially European stocks, have had the tightest correlation with US equities. Meanwhile, emerging-markets stocks have tended to have lower correlations with US stocks, and those correlations have generally trended down since 2000. Three-Year Correlation Matrix:International Equity. Source:Morningstar Direct. Data as of Dec. 31, 2023. The small subset of European stocks from markets classified as emerging have had the lowest correlation with the US market over the past three years, with correlations declining significantly in 2022 and falling further still in 2023. (At the end of 2021, the three-year correlation of the Morningstar Emerging Markets Europe Index with the US market was 0.82; by the end of 2023, it was just 0.16.) That steep drop in correlations owed largely to Eastern European equities' sharp losses following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. Such stocks are just 1.3% of the broader Morningstar Emerging Markets Index, however, and they are a negligible slice of the Morningstar Global Markets ex-US Index. Longer-Term Trends. While non-US stocks, especially those from developed markets, have exhibited a high correlation with the US market in recent years, that hasn't always been the case. As shown below, correlations between the US and international markets have been lower in some previous periods, such as from 2004 through 2008, when the US dollar was generally on the decline. If the greenback goes into another longer-term slump, or if the US sinks into recession but other major non-US markets manage to avoid one, it is conceivable that correlations between US and international markets could again drift lower. Rolling Three-Year Correlations v. US Market Index:International Equity. Source:Morningstar Direct. Data as of Dec. 31, 2023. Longer-term correlations also demonstrate that emerging markets generally have a lower correlation with US stocks than developed markets do. That's because the types of industries that are especially prominent in emerging markets, particularly energy and basic materials, have declined as a percentage of the US market. In addition, the Chinese economy, which represents roughly 30% of major emerging-markets indexes, follows a different economic cycle than the US does. Finally, emerging markets are more likely than developed markets to be affected by country- and region-specific geopolitical events-political instability, wars, and currency devaluations-that have little to do with the US. Taken together, those features suggest that emerging-markets equities' low correlation with US stocks won't be as fleeting as some of the other correlation trends. Portfolio Implications. While investors who have diversified internationally haven't much benefited over the past decade, their portfolios have been slightly less volatile relative to a US-only portfolio. The 10-year standard deviation of the Morningstar US Market Index is 15.5, whereas the standard deviation of the Morningstar Global Markets Index, which includes both US and non-US names, is 15.0. Japan, in particular, has exhibited milder volatility than the US market and other major non-US markets. Moreover, the US market has become increasingly growth-tilted:29% of the Morningstar US Market Index lands in the technology sector, for example, whereas just 12% of the Morningstar Global Markets ex-US Index does. That has been a boon for US-only investors as technology names soared for most of the past decade. But in a period in which lower-priced stocks lead the way, non-US stocks could outperform and help diversify US exposure. Non-US indexes feature a heavier emphasis on traditional value sectors, including energy, basic materials, and financials. Because emerging markets have generally had a lower correlation with the US equity market than the developed markets' correlation, investors seeking diversification may want to make sure their foreign-stock allocation includes at least some exposure to less-developed markets. And while some specific regions have been better portfolio diversifiers than others, most investors will probably want to shy away from investment vehicles that focus solely on a particular geographic region.", "gpt_labels": [], "gpt_explanation": "\n\n\nExplanation: The text provided is an article discussing international diversification in investment portfolios, authored by John Gesek and originally published by Christine Benz in Morningstar.

The U.S. and (to a lesser extent) global equity markets continue to generate positive returns for investors, the bond market is settling down and the long-predicted recession keeps being moved back by the market pundits. It's almost easy to forget that bear markets ever happen, given the returns of last year and this year's first two quarter. The gains have slowed down from the red-hot first quarter, but they are still historically robust. The Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index-the broadest measure of U.S. stocks-gained 3.31% for the year's second quarter, and stands at a 13.58% gain since January 1. The Russell 3000 index has gained 13.56% so far this year. Looking at large cap stocks, the Wilshire U.S. 2500 Large Cap index was up 3.43% for the second quarter, with a 13.79% gain so far in 2024. The Russell 1000 large-cap index is up 14.25% so far this year, while the widely-quoted S&P 500 index of large company stocks gained 3.92% during the year's second quarter, and is now sitting on a 14.48% gain for the year so far. Meanwhile, the Russell Midcap Index is up 4.96% in the first half of 2024. As measured by the Russell 2000 Small-Cap Index, smaller companies posted a 1.73% gain in the year's first six months. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index has gained 18.13% so far this year. Foreign markets are up for the year as well. The broad-based EAFE index of companies in developed foreign economies has gained 3.51% in the first half of 2024. Emerging market stocks of less developed countries, as represented by the EAFE EM index, have gained 6.11% in dollar terms so far this year. Real estate securities posted an essentially flat quarter, with the Wilshire U.S. REIT index down 0.25% for the quarter and down 0.26% for the year so far. The S&P GSCI index, which measures commodities returns, lost 0.70% in the second quarter, but still hold a 7.98% gain in 2024 so far. Gold prices are booming, up 12.83% for the quarter to a near-record $2,327 an ounce. The S&P 500 utilities index, a broad measure of the performance of utility stocks, is churning along with a 3.85% return for the most recent quarter, now delivering 7.58% for the year. The bond markets seem to have settled into stability, though we are still experiencing an inverted yield curve. Yields on 10-year Treasury bonds rose slightly from 4.32% at the start of the quarter to 4.40% currently. 30-year government bond yields have risen incrementally from 4.46% in the first quarter to 4.56% today. But with the inverted yield investors can get higher returns on, respectively, 12-month Treasuries (5.11% rate, 6-month government (5.32%) and 3-month Treasury bills (5.35%). Five-year municipal bonds have risen from a 2.44% aggregate yield to 2.96%, while 30-year munis moved from roughly 3.75% in the first quarter to 3.79% today. The markets seem to be testing new highs every week or so, but the first thing you notice, if you look closely at the numbers, is the more modest returns experienced in the second quarter compared with the first. The commentators and pundits interpret that as the markets 'running out of steam,' as if daily and monthly price movements are produced by some kind of mechanical engine. They're not. The early part of the year might be fairly described as a period of overenthusiasm, while today investors seem to be more relaxed about the possibility of 'missing out.'. The chief worry as we enter the third quarter is that much of the equity returns are coming from small handful of AI-related companies. The companies that are most closely associated with AI developments-Nvidia, Apple, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft-are soaring even as the rest of the market is taking a pause. As a result, the S&P 500 is also soaring, on a very thin number of big winners. Microsoft has seen its shares soar nearly 75% since the beginning of last year, after announcing its OpenAI initiative. NVIDIA's share price has increased 149.48% in the first two quarters of this year. Amazon, which provides extensive server farms, is up more than 27% this year. Analysts and investors with long memories are telling us that they've seen this movie before:new technology promises to change our economic landscape, creating vast efficiency improvements and permeating every aspect of our lives. The new technology actually does that, but in the process, investors in the new technology lose billions. The market reminiscence is the Tech boom of the 1990s and the massive collapse of stock prices-known as the tech wreck-that ushered in the new millennium. Will companies find a way to use AI technology in a way that benefits their bottom line? Eventually, yes. But currently, the new technology is a cost rather than a source of revenue for all but a small handful of companies. Yes, Nvidia, the chip maker, is generating record profits-and gains. Apple Computer plans to harvest AI in its iPhones, but does that mean it will sell more phones than it has in the past? Microsoft, which pioneered ChatGPT, hasn't yet seen the investment generate a boost to the bottom line, and, well, other than writing college essays and maybe having computers man the phone lines to handle FAQs that are also posted on the website, what's the use case? A recent study found that, as of today, fewer than 6% of large firms are using AI-related technologies in a meaningful way. A secondary worry is how AI models are straining our energy systems-which, of course, are also the utilities that run our air conditioners in the summer. A number of reports have suggested that our electrical systems are groaning under the weight of this new AI-driven demand; a generative AI system uses 33 times more energy than computers running task-specific software, and the computations rely on giant data centers that suck up energy. In 2022, the last year we have statistics, data centers used 450 terawatt hours of electricity, and that is expected to double in the next two years. At that time, the demand consumption will be roughly equivalent to the electricity consumption of Japan. We are starting to hear ordinary people talking about their investment portfolios, and the AI sector of the stock market, in cabs, hair salons and dinner conversations. Whenever that happens, you can fairly suspect that there's a bubble forming in whatever they're talking about. There is no question that AI will change our business and personal lives, perhaps dramatically, the way software and information technology have done. But history has shown that investing in transformative technologies can be tricky at best. The bigger question, that will be answered in the next 12 months, is whether the rest of the market will hold up if there is a (perhaps temporary) pullback in the highest-performing tech stocks in our investment indices.", "gpt_labels": [], "gpt_explanation": "\n\n\nExplanation:\n\n- The text provided is an investment report focusing on market trends, stock performance, and economic analysis.

Written By John Gesek. Not everybody makes contributions to donor-advised funds (DAFs), but the concept has become more popular with the expanded standard deduction. Many people who had been making donations to their favorite charity, whose overall deductions didn't rise to the level of the standard deduction, suddenly found that their charitable contributions were no longer providing a tax benefit. Enter the donor-advised fund, which collects contributions today, and donations to specified charitable organizations can be made, out of the fund, at a future date. This makes it feasible for people to contribute, say, five years worth of donations in a single year. Presto!The donations plus other deductions would exceed the standard deduction, and the tax benefits of the donations are restored. But the concept has come under recent scrutiny from the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS can't tell taxpayers they cannot bunch multiple years of contributions into a single year, but it CAN add some enforcement to how the distributions are made. A new proposal would create a tax penalty on any donation that are made to disqualified entities-that is, a recipient of the donation that is a family member of the donor, a related person or a board member of the fund. In addition, all donations are required to be awarded on an objective and nondiscriminatory basis according to procedures specified and approved in advance. The tax penalty would amount to 20% of the amount granted, and the donation would have to be returned.", "gpt_labels": [], "gpt_explanation": "\n\n\nExplanation: The text provided discusses updates to regulations regarding donor-advised funds (DAFs) and the implications of these changes.

Hence, we offer a simple and competitive advisory fee based on your portfolio's value. We've designed it to be easy to understand and we believe it puts your interests first. Know The Total Cost of Investment. When calculating the cost to invest, one needs to be mindful of the different participants and their roles. The investment advisor, custodian, investment management companies, separately managed account (SMA's) manager, and third-party administrators (TPA's) necessary for some qualified retirement accounts, to name a few. Each has their own role and pricing for services which can vastly affect your cost to invest. It is best to know this information ahead of time to be able to make an educated decision about who you are going to invest with. Questions To Ask Your Financial Professional. Your financial professional's compensation can create hidden conflicts of interest. For example, some money managers earn commissions on products they sell, such as funds or annuities, in addition the management fees they collect. Others base certain fees on performance, which can encourage chasing short-term returns and hinder risk management. When considering professional money management, here are some questions you can ask to learn more about the fees you might pay. How do you structure your fees?. Does the recommended custodian charge a fee to have accounts at their firm? If so, what is the cost?. What other compensation do you receive besides what I pay you directly? Do you collect commissions or other incentives?. Are you recommending a transaction based account or a \"wrap\" account? What are the costs associated with the type of account recommended?. Will you use an outside money manager or separately managed account (SMA) in my portfolio? What fees will I pay for these?. What is the cost of the investments in the recommended strategy?. If you have questions about Optimus Capital Advisors' fees, or the fees you're paying with your current portfolio, contact us to request an evaluation. We can review your portfolio, discuss the fees you may be paying, and let you know how we compare.

The ban covers everyone except senior executives who are in a 'policy-making position,\" for whom existing noncompetes will be grandfathered. The final Rule defines a \"non-compete clause\" as \"a term or condition of employment that prohibits a worker from, penalizes a worker for, or functions to prevent a worker from (1) seeking or accepting work in the United States with a different person where such work would begin after the conclusion of the employment that includes the term or condition; or (2) operating a business in the United States after the conclusion of the employment that includes the term or condition.\". The Rule applies broadly to all employees, independent contractors, externs, interns, volunteers, apprentices, or sole proprietors who provide a service. However, non-disclosure agreements and non-solicitation agreements that would not prevent a worker from taking a new job or starting a new business are still considered legally valid, subject to state laws. If the noncompete ban holds up in court, then it will take effect later this year, and the FTC expects that 30 million people-one in five American workers-will be affected. The impact could lead to more people moving to new jobs more freely than they could when noncompetes were enforceable. The FTC suggests that the ruling will lead to a 2.7% increase in the rate of new small business creation, resulting in an additional 8,500 new businesses created each year. But there will definitely be a court challenge.

Trust A Process Guided By These Beliefs. (1) We believe the success of any venture increases greatly with planning. (2) We believe that the capital markets will reward long-term investors. (3) We believe in knowledge over emotion. (4) We believe in reason over impulsiveness. (5) We believe in focusing our efforts on what we can control. We work diligently to get to know you and your and family personally. We will attempt and uncover your immediate and longer-term objectives, what your appetite for risk is, and the values that are important to you before we ever discuss investing your money. Once we ascertain your goals, we construct a wealth management plan as a roadmap for effectively and efficiently investing your money. This plan will evolve over time to make sure it continues to meet your needs, and objectives throughout the time we work together. Our philosophy on investing is rooted in Nobel prize winning research and employs a multi-factor investment approach:we believe that the capital markets process information very efficiently and will reward long-term investors. Investing across broad geographic regions and including multiple asset classes enables us to capture the premiums that exist through different market cycles. We are committed to keeping portfolio costs low and being tax efficient as we implement the plan. Most importantly, we believe in integrity, knowing that trust and respect are the only ways to do business. Adhering To Principles That Increase Investment Success. Let the Markets Work for You:The financial markets have rewarded long-term investors. People expect a return on the capital they supply, and historically, the equity, commercial real estate, bond, and private markets have provided growth of wealth that has more than offset the effects of inflation. Resist Chasing Past Performance:Some investors select investments based on past returns. However, research shows that past performance offers little insight into the investments future returns. Consider the Drivers of Return:Academic research has identified certain equity and fixed income dimensions, which point to differences in expected returns. You can pursue higher expected returns by structuring portfolios around these dimensions or factors. Practice Smart Diversification:Diversification helps reduce risks that have no expected return but diversifying within your home market is not enough. Global diversification of more than stocks and bonds can broaden your investment universe. Avoid Market Timing:You never know which market segments will outperform from year to year. By holding a globally diversified portfolio you are well positioned to seek returns wherever they occur. Understand Your Risk Capacity and Tolerance:Aligning your investments to meet your objectives should be your number one priority. Understanding your capacity to take risk and the volatility you are willing to accept is essential to designing an appropriate allocation. Manage Emotions:Many people struggle to separate their emotions from investing. Markets go up and down and the volatility can become frightening. Reacting to current market conditions may lead to making poor investment decisions. We work to avoid reactive investing!. Look Beyond the Headlines:Daily market news and commentary can challenge your investment discipline. Some messages stir anxiety about the future, while others tempt you to chase the latest investment fad. When headlines are unsettling, we consider the source and maintain a long-term perspective. Manage Expenses, Turnover and Taxes:By keeping the cost of investment low, turnover to a minimum, and being mindful of the type and placement of investments goes a long way to achieving better investment outcomes.

Small changes in parameters can effect an injectors output and running characteristics. This page is to help explain more about what we do, why, and how - to a limited extent. Assembly:Common rail injectors are extremely sensitive to dust, dirt and the equivalent during the assembly process. Clean rooms are not only a good idea, but certainly a requirement for the best results. With clearances measured in microns, even a small piece of lint can cause the set-up process to fail. This same lint particle can actually tuck away inside the injector and make its way to a critical area after the measuring process. We have developed some mechanisms to deal with these types of issues over the years. Also, wetted parts (assembled with test oil) or dry parts will have differing values, so it is important to appreciate the changes this can have while working up an injector. Multiple measurements take place during injector work up and each measurement needs to be taken more than one time and with multiple, noted as good, gauges. 99% of common rail injector functionality is determined during assembly!When building injectors, a test bench is only to verify the work you did. Test bench data can sometimes show an injector as good, but the injector internal values can be incorrect. Calibration:This is predominantly done during the assembly and work up side of things, but calibration changes take place while the injector is being bench tested. As the injector delivery is measured, adjustment is sometimes needed to obtain the desired fueling volume. Changing pintle lift or solenoid air gap is a good example. Mounting and dis-mounting the injectors from the test bench during the calibration phase is common.

Roofing felt, underlayment, roll roofing\u2026Regardless of what you call it, it is an important part of your roof. But, what is roofing felt? Check out our guide. Each component of your roof has an important job - and felt underlayment is no exception. For more than two and a half decades, professional roofing organizations have recommended that contractors use felt during roof construction. The material provides waterproofing, and some municipalities require it by law. Roofing felt is an extra layer of shielding that protects your roof and the structure of your home. Keep reading to find out more about the vital role of roof felt. What Is Roofing Felt?. You may have heard roofing felt referred to by many names. For instance, contractors sometimes call it felt underlayment, roll roofing, or roofing tar paper. They install this protective material between shingles and roof decks. It's important not to confuse roof felt with felt roof shingles. The material is similar, but without the asphalt covering. Manufacturers typically make standard roof felt with a natural base material such as wood cellulose. More recently, however, synthetic roof underlayment has grown in popularity. Manufacturers make synthetic roofing paper with material such as fiberglass or polyester. They may also coat it with asphalt. Synthetic roofing paper is a breathable, protective coating that does a remarkable job of repelling moisture. Over the years, roofing contractors have recognized the value of an extra layer of protection between shingles and roof decks. Also, underlayment results in a better-looking finished product that lasts longer. Because roof felt underlayment shores up your roof, it also helps protect the underlying framework of your home from the damaging elements. In the unfortunate event that moisture gets under your shingles, roofing felt prevents it from getting to your roof deck. It also protects water from getting trapped under your shingles. In turn, the material prevents leaks , rotting, mold and moisture damage. How to Install Roofing Felt. Usually, manufacturers produce roofing felt in 36-inch rolls. Contractors roll the material over a roof deck in overlapping strips. If you're installing roofing felt, you should start at the bottom and then work your way up. If water gets past the shingles, this pattern will make it easy for it to roll down the roof. The moisture will then escape the roof shingles at the next opening and continue to the rain gutter. Roofing felt installation is relatively straightforward. However, you should exercise caution when installing the material. It's important that you cover the roof completely. Wrinkles, gaps, or an incorrect overlay will compromise the material's ability to protect the roof deck. To secure standard roofing felt, you'll need a hammer tacker. The tool makes it easy to staple roofing felt in place. It's the fastest way to install the material. With this tool, you'd use the same swing as you would with a hammer. With each impact, it will staple the paper to the deck. A tacking hammer greatly reduces the time needed to install roof felt underlay compared to using a staple gun. If you aren't comfortable or knowledgeable when it comes to roofing installation, you should contact a trusted professional. McCoy Roofing will always answer your questions with honesty and complete your projects with integrity and professionalism. Synthetic Felt:A Step-Up From the Norm. For decades, contractors have used roofing felt that's composed of heavy-duty wood cellulose. Now, however, synthetic roofing underlayment is quickly gaining popularity. Eventually, it may become an industry standard. Contractors are making the switch for several reasons. Mainly, it's lighter, stronger, and safer to walk on. Synthetic roofing underlayment is a polyester or fiberglass material soaked in a waterproofing agent. Manufacturers typically make the roofing material available in two thicknesses. It comes in 15- or 30-pound weight. When manufacturers established this standard, these weights correlated with the weight of 100 square feet of material. Now, however, the rolls are somewhat lighter. Nevertheless, the standard remains. As with traditional felt, a heavier weight provides better performance. Synthetic felt can offer benefits beyond better weather proofing. For example, most manufacturers make traditional roofing felt using black pigment. Synthetic felt may come in a range of light colors which collect less heat. Accordingly, synthetic felt results in a cooler roof and lowered energy consumption. Synthetic felt also performs better in the cold. In the winter, traditional felt tends to curl. Cold temperatures don't have this effect on synthetic material. There is one area, however, where traditional felt has an advantage. You can't use a lightweight hammer tacker to install synthetic felt. You must use roofing nails. Still, you can overcome this issue easily with the right roofing nail gun. Make Your Roofs Last Longer With Synthetic Felt. It's important to choose a roofer that knows how to work with synthetic underlayment. Synthetic felt has a lower permeability (perm) rating compared to standard roof felt. Resultantly, moisture cannot escape as easily through the material. For this reason, it's important to hire a contractor that knows how to vent a roof properly when using synthetic felt. Also, all synthetic underlayment may not work with all kinds of shingles. A contractor must know how to match various synthetic felt to roof coverings.

{"company_id": 397799, "page_url": "https://mccoyroofing.com/how-much-does-a-metal-roof-cost/", "company_name": "Superior Roofing LLC", "text": "How Much Does a Metal Roof Cost?. It\u2019s been a hot, dry summer, but those clouds on the horizon are promising rain. Pretty soon it\u2019ll be time to run for cover, but is your roof prepared for the downpour?. There\u2019s nothing better than sitting down to watch your favorite TV show while the rain patters down on your new metal roof, but roof replacement can become expensive faster than that downpour begins and ends. A 24-gauge standing seam metal roof usually costs between $10,000 and $14,000, but this handy remodeling calculator can help you figure out what it might cost to replace or repair your old roof. Once you have an idea about your price range, you should know the benefits of replacing your roof versus getting your old roof repaired. Here are some of the benefits and drawbacks of each option. Choosing Your Roofing. If you opt to repair your old roof, this decision is easy. Just go with the same type and color of roofing you already have. The only issue with this is the possibility that you\u2019ll be trying to replace a type of roofing that no longer exists in today\u2019s market. If you find yourself trying to replace a type of tile that hasn\u2019t existed since the 70s (been there, done that), you may want to invest in a whole new roof instead. So what are your options?. Slate, wood, asphalt, or other shingles. Clay or concrete tile. Rolled roofing. Membrane roofing. R-panel roofing. Standing seam. The issues with tile and shingles have to do with durability. The adhesive can fail, leaving you with a landslide of broken roofing. Other materials rip or shatter with the weather. Rolled roofing is designed for short-term use, lasting only a decade and looking like an eyesore in the meantime. Membrane roofing can last longer, up to 35 years, but is still subject to heat and puncture damage. Finally, there are the metal roofing materials. R-panel and standing seam both offer superior durability with resistance to fire, puncturing, and all kinds of weather. R-panel roofing, however, varies widely in quality and is prone to wear over time as the exposed fasteners are forced to shift and wear away the panels. Though R-paneling is cheaper, standing seam offers even more water resistance and can last over 50 years. Some people wonder if metal roofing blocks cell phone reception, but that is not the case. Neither R-panel nor standing seam roofing will keep you out of the loop despite their tough exteriors. Insurance Costs. Standing seam metal roofing offers protection that insurance companies are willing to get behind. Because of standing seam\u2019s durability, fire and water resistance, you may recoup the cost of your roof replacement with lower premiums. The interlocking panels of standing seam roofing hide the fasteners that hold down the roof, thereby protecting them from inclement weather and you from high insurance rates. Metal roofs are favored by insurance companies , which also prefer hip roofs and newer roofs in good condition. However, be wary of scam roofing companies that claim to pay your insurance deductible. This practice is not legal. Your new roof may pay for itself by preventing future repair costs and lowering your premiums, but your roofing company will not pay any of your insurance costs. Instead of falling for one of these scams, look into getting a warranty on your new roof. The first few repairs on your roof may be free if your warranty has not expired. If your warranty has expired, your insurance company may cover the cost of repairs. Though your roofing company will not pay your insurance premiums, they can help you make a claim. Look into policies that cover cosmetic damage as well as structural damage, because superficial dents may not be covered if the roof is still functional. Style. For some, a metal roof brings to mind the image of a rusty corrugated tin roof held down by old tires, but the interlocking panels of a standing seam roof meet at clean angles that compliment any home. Metal roofs come in a variety of colors and can even mimic the look of tile or shingles. Even so, the sleek look of a metal roof can draw envious looks from neighbors all on its own. Whatever color panels you choose, your home will look modern and well built, which will increase the resale value of your home when it\u2019s time to move. Durability. While a standing seam metal roof is a durable style, to begin with, the thickness of your metal will also determine how devastating that felled tree or impromptu hailstorm is to your roof. Some popular options are. 24 gauge \u2013 the thickest. 26 gauge \u2013 the most common thickness. 29 gauge \u2013 the thinnest. Many contractors recommend 24 or 26 gauge panels because they offer dent protection and maintain a good look for years to come. Other roofing will leak due to missing or damaged tiles or damaged flashing. The leak-resistant design of standing seam metal avoids the loss of any panels and covers the flashing completely, leaving your home warm and dry. Your New Roof. Whether you are ready to replace your old roof or build a new home, standing seam metal roofing is the most attractive, longest-lasting material you can choose. A metal roof pays for itself by lowering your insurance rates and increasing the resale value of your home. No matter the weather in your area, a standing seam roof will protect your home from the fiercest heat and the toughest storm. Overall, the benefits of a standing seam roof will save you money and anxiety for the life of your home.", "gpt_labels": ["description.product"], "gpt_explanation": "\n\n\nExplanation:\n\n- **Contains detailed description of a product of the company**: True.

{"company_id": 397799, "page_url": "https://mccoyroofing.com/roofing-trends-in-2023/", "company_name": "Superior Roofing LLC", "text": "Roofing Trends in 2023. 2023 is expected to bring a wave of new and exciting roofing trends, with sustainable materials and technologies taking the lead, and McCoy Roofing wants to ensure you're up-to-date with the latest roofing trends. Homeowners are becoming increasingly aware of the need for good insulation when it comes to roofs, as well as durability and energy efficiency. Many 2023 roofing trends have been inspired by these values, resulting in lighter-weight materials that can still provide a high level of protection and performance. New and Improved Roofing Trends in 2023. Metal Roofs are becoming increasingly popular for a variety of reasons, and this trend is projected to continue into 2023. Metal roofs require less maintenance than traditional asphalt shingles, as they don't need to be replaced every 10-20 years. They also offer superior weather protection against hail, high winds, and snow accumulation. Additionally, metal roofs can help lower energy bills by reflecting sunlight away from the home and decreasing heat transfer between the attic and living space below. And finally, this choice among popular roofing trends in 2023, has an attractive look that comes in a wide range of colors to match any home's style. Sustainable Roofs. This year, sustainable roofs are poised to become increasingly favored roofing trends due to the rising costs of energy and the benefits they offer. Sustainable roofs are designed with energy efficiency in mind and use materials that help reduce heat loss in winter and keep buildings cooler in summer. This means that less energy is needed for heating and cooling, resulting in lower utility bills and increased savings over time. Additionally, these roofs provide better insulation from outside noise, making them an excellent choice for homeowners who live on noisy streets or near busy roads. Furthermore, by using recycled materials such as roofing tiles made from recycled plastic bottles, sustainable roofs also reduce waste going into landfills. And because they last longer than traditional roofing systems, homeowners can expect fewer maintenance costs over time. With all these benefits, it's no wonder sustainable roofs are expected to become increasingly popular in 2023. Bright and vibrant colors are expected to be one of the popular roofing trends in 2023, as they provide the opportunity to create eye-catching designs on the roofline. The trend of having colorful roofs have been around for some time, but it's only recently that the technology and materials necessary to make them more practical have become more accessible to the public. Bright and colorful roofs are great for many reasons. They can help improve energy efficiency by reflecting heat from the sun, they can help reduce urban temperatures, they provide additional insulation during winter months, they add visual appeal to buildings, and they can even increase property values. In addition, many people find that adding color gives their houses a unique look that makes them stand out among other houses in their neighborhood. Green Roofs. Homeowners who want something truly unique can opt for green roofs, which involve filling flat surfaces with soil and vegetation to create an attractive living environment. These living systems are capable of absorbing and storing rainwater, reducing the amount of runoff produced during storms and helping to prevent flooding. They also act as natural insulators against heat, helping to reduce energy costs and combat the urban 'heat island' effect. Green roofs can also provide habitats for birds and insects, help improve air quality by absorbing pollutants, and even generate food in some instances. In 2023, it is expected that green roofs will be far more popular roofing trends in 2023 than in previous years due to a growing awareness of these environmental benefits. In addition, as cities become increasingly dense with development, green roofs offer an attractive solution that can help make our urban environments healthier places to live. Smart Roofs. Smart roofs will be wanted by homeowners due to their energy efficiency and flexibility. In 2023, smart roof technology is expected to become even more prevalent as the costs of these systems continue to decline, and their ability to provide energy savings and sustainability become better understood. Smart roofs can help reduce energy bills by reflecting sunlight away from a home or building while also helping reduce the urban heat island effect that can cause temperatures in cities to rise during hot weather. Additionally, they provide more efficient insulation than traditional roofing materials, meaning homeowners may pay lower heating and cooling costs throughout the year. Smart roofs also offer protection against extreme weather events like hailstorms and hurricanes and enhanced security against intruders. With all these advantages, it is no surprise that smart roofs will become increasingly popular roofing trends in 2023 and beyond. Solar panel roofs have seen a surge in popularity in recent years thanks to the many benefits they offer. Firstly, technological advancements have made solar panels more efficient and cost-effective, making them an attractive option for homeowners. Solar panel roofs also provide significant savings on energy bills, helping to reduce dependence on traditional sources of electricity like coal or natural gas. Additionally, the environmental benefits of installing solar panels cannot be overstated - they help reduce carbon emissions and contribute towards reducing our impact on climate change. With governments around the world introducing new incentives aimed at encouraging people to switch to renewable energy sources like solar power, it is likely that we will see a surge in the popularity of solar roof installations in 2023. This will create countless jobs within the industry and benefit the economy as a whole. McCoy Roofing Stays Ahead of Roofing Trends. At McCoy Roofing , we strive to stay ahead of the curve of current roofing trends in 2023. This year is set to be an excellent year for roofing trends, with homeowners having more options than ever before when it comes to choosing suitable materials and technologies for their homes.

Have you been worried that you won\u2019t replace your roof soon enough? Read on to learn about the signs that it is time for a replacement roof. As with anything in life, homes require maintenance to ensure that they are doing their job and keeping you comfortable and safe. It\u2019s easy enough to tell when certain parts of your house need maintenance. When your air conditioner stops working, you should get a new one. When the color of your walls starts to fade, it\u2019s time to repaint them. But how do you know when it\u2019s time to get a replacement roof?. As the barrier between you and the elements, it\u2019s essential that you make sure your roof is doing its job. Keep reading for 7 signs that it may be time to replace your roof. 1. Your Neighbors Have Already Replaced Their Roofs. While this may be dependent on the age of your house, if all of your local neighbors have already had a roof replacement , it may be a good idea for you to do the same. Even if your roof appears to be in decent shape, if it is 25 to 30 years old, it may contain hidden damage. Older roofs use materials that are no longer considered as strong or useful. If your roof is less than 20 years old, a good inspection will be able to tell you if you need to do any replacements. At McCoy Roofing, we pride ourselves on absolute honesty. If your roof doesn't need replacing, we'll tell you!It's always important to get an inspection from a reputable company that you trust. As homes in neighborhoods are oftentimes built in the same time period and in a similar fashion, paying attention to their upgrades can help you determine when you should as well. 2. Shingle Issues. When looking at the exterior of your house, look for any noticeable shingle damage present. Materials such as wood and asphalt can experience rot, but a shingle roof should not be decaying. If you find areas with missing shingles or places with curling, cracking, or out of place shingles, you may need a replacement roof. Although windstorms can be powerful, a solid roof should be able to withstand it and stay flat. You should also look for pieces and particles of your shingles in the gutter. If you find them washed down in there, this could mean that your roof is vulnerable to water damage and decay. 3. Visible Streaks and Discoloration (Inside and Out). When you\u2019re inside your house, check for any dark streaks or stains on your roof\u2019s underside. You can also look for them running from the roof down your walls. Streaks and discoloration can indicate that there is a buildup of moisture. You can also check for discoloration on the exterior of your house. Just like when inspecting the interior, look for any dark stains or streaks present on the surface. If something looks off, there\u2019s a good chance that it is!. Streaks and discoloration may not mean you need a total roof replacement. You should still take note of their location, however, in case they are a sign of a deeper problem. 4. Leaks and Water Damage. One clear way to know that your roof has a problem is if it\u2019s leaking. Oftentimes you can notice this in the attic of your house. Leaks can occur after rainstorms, as well as when the snow melts. No matter how small the leak may seem, it\u2019s essential that you get your roof repaired. Exposed nails on the exterior of your roof can also signal leaks or cracks. If you don\u2019t take measures to fix the leak, it can cause additional damage to the other parts of your home and foundation. Water can cause rotting, as well as promote the growth of mold. Aside from affecting your home, this can also affect your health. 5. You Can See Daylight. A skylight is an enviable house feature, while a hole in your roof is not. In the daytime, perform an interior inspection. If your house has an attic, you can start by looking there. If at any time you see a stream of light filtering down into your home, replace your roof immediately. It\u2019s a sign that your roof has a crack or even a hole. If the light is able to come through your roof, that means that water or moisture can as well. Get it fixed before more serious problems develop!. 6. Sagging Areas. Have you ever seen what happens to a box when it\u2019s wet? Just like a wet piece of cardboard will sag, your roof can do the same. In the Midwest, snow can pile up for weeks and even months. The combination of weight and moisture could be the cause of a sagging roof. When you are inside your house, look for sagging areas on the underside of your roof. Once you identify them, take a broom and prod them gently. If the areas feel wet or soft and bend once you tap them with a broom, your roof has moisture damage. 7. Your Energy Bills Are Inexplicably Rising. Your energy bills should be consistent from month to month. If you notice that they are gradually increasing, it may be due to a problem with your roof. Roofs are built to insulate and protect. If they are doing their job correctly, they will work to maintain the temperature of the home. When a roof is not functioning well, your HVAC system will have to work overtime to maintain a comfortable temperature. Rising energy bills may signal that it\u2019s time for residential roof replacement. Let Us Help You With Your Replacement Roof. As one of the most important parts of your house, it\u2019s essential that you maintain your roof. Part of that involves knowing when it\u2019s the right time to get a replacement roof. When left unchecked, damaged roofs can not only affect the rest of your house but also your health. Pay attention to these 7 signs, and make sure that your roof is working as it should.", "gpt_labels": [], "gpt_explanation": "\n\n\nExplanation:\n\n- The text primarily provides information on signs that indicate the need for a roof replacement.

Having your roof inspected before selling your home is a smart move. A qualified inspector will be able to identify any potential issues or concerns with the roof that could delay or disrupt the sale of your home. Reasons Why Get Your Roof Inspected Before Selling Your Home. They may also be able to recommend necessary repairs or upgrades that can improve the value of your home and make it more attractive to potential buyers. An inspection can help provide peace of mind for you and the buyer and should not be overlooked when preparing to sell a home.

Are you wondering what color of siding goes with different colors of brick? Check out our guide as we look at this question and get your perfect match today. Choosing The Best Siding Colors for Different Colors of Brick on Your Home. Did you know that certain types of home siding can last decades before needing to be replaced? Of course, the siding will only last this long if you take care of it. Otherwise, the color of the siding will start to fade and the siding itself will no longer be very good at protecting your home. And speaking of siding color, do you know what color of siding goes best with your color of bricks? There are actually many different color combinations that you can try out. Even though brick doesn\u2019t come in many different shades, siding tends to come in dozens and even hundreds of shades, so you\u2019ll never run out of combinations. Keep reading and learn more about matching the color of your home\u2019s bricks to different types of siding. Red Brick and Teal Siding. Sometimes, the best siding and brick combinations are the ones that aren\u2019t immediately obvious. For example, many people don\u2019t think about matching red brick with teal (a blue-green shade). After all, teal is such a different color compared to red brick. It doesn\u2019t seem like these two colors would go well together. Instead, they might look very ugly. But when you actually put teal siding alongside red brick, you will find that, somehow, these two contrasting colors go perfectly together. It may be the fact that they are so different that makes them go so well together. Once you install siding in this blue-green color, you will find that the teal shade somehow takes the edge off of the red brick color. This way, the red brick isn\u2019t so harsh and doesn\u2019t call all of the attention when looking at your house\u2019s exterior. The Details. In the wrong circumstances, the teal siding could look somewhat dull. This is because teal is a darker, more neutral shade compared to other types of blue or green. For that reason, if you don\u2019t use teal in the right way, it can look very bland and lifeless. But when you put it next to red brick, the brick can liven up the teal without overpowering it. For that reason, red brick and teal siding perfectly balance each other out and create a very attractive home exterior. Have a different color of brick? Read on for our suggestions. Tan Brick and Burgundy Siding. Tan brick isn\u2019t as popular as red brick, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it still can\u2019t be stylish. However, you may have a more difficult time finding siding that matches tan brick. This is because tan brick isn't as bold as red brick. For that reason, the tan color can easily get overrun by any color that is slightly stronger or brighter beside it. Because tan brick is on the lighter side, you will want to avoid siding that is also light in color. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll find that the light siding will wash out the light-colored bricks and vice versa. As a result, your whole house will look quite drab and washed out. On the other hand, you don\u2019t want to choose very bright or vibrant siding, because such colors will completely overpower the bricks. Darker Shades. Instead, you will want to lean toward darker shades so that the darker siding and the lighter bricks can balance each other out. Dark red or burgundy siding can be the ideal match for tan bricks. Why?. Tan brick usually has some hints of red or pink in it, but these hints are too faint to really notice. But, when you add some red to your house\u2019s siding, you will find that this siding will bring out the red hues from the brick. As a result, the brick will seem to have much more color than before and it will be much more attractive. Burgundy is ideal because it is not bright red. Instead, it is subtle and sophisticated. For that very reason, it will do well elevating tan brick from its bland status. Red Brick and Neutral Siding. Sometimes, red brick can be a little too brash on a house\u2019s exterior. While the red hue is undoubtedly attractive, too much of it can make your house an eyesore. Bright siding colors will only make this problem worse. To fix this issue, all you have to do is choose a neutral siding color. There are many options to choose from when it comes to neutral siding. For example, beige, light blue, and cream are all popular siding colors. The aim of these neutral colors is to detract attention from the red bricks. Of course, the neutral siding will not completely de-emphasize the appearance of the bricks. Instead, the siding will work to balance out the bright red color. This way, the resulting appearance of your house will be much more balanced than before. This is especially important if you care about your house\u2019s curb appeal.

{"company_id": 397799, "page_url": "https://mccoyroofing.com/what-you-should-know-about-clay-tile-roofs/", "company_name": "Superior Roofing LLC", "text": "What You Should Know About Clay Tile Roofs. Have you considered installing a clay tile roof? It\u2019s not a bad option. However, there are a few things to consider before you commit. The clay tile roof style is both timeless and beautiful. The tiles are durable, lasting upwards of a hundred years on your home. At the same time, they're more expensive than a conventional roof and, despite their durability, can also be quite brittle. We\u2019re here to help you weigh your options and determine if a clay tile roof is right for your home. Check out our guide to learn more. They\u2019re Super Durable. The average lifespan of a clay tile roof is about a hundred years. This number varies, depending on the climate; not all clay roof tiles are the same. Some types of clay tiles don\u2019t do well in cold climates, for example. They wear down under constant stress from ice and snow. Always research ahead of time. Discover what type of clay tiles last in your specific environment before committing to a purchase. Also, it\u2019s important to note that while clay roof tiles are durable, brittleness is a common issue. If a horrible storm brushes through and a tree lands on your roof, tiles may shatter under its weight. If this happens, you\u2019ll need to get some repairs done. A Clay Tile Roof is Invulnerable to Rot and Insects. Once bugs infiltrate your wooden roof, they eat away at the material and do some serious damage. This isn\u2019t something you have to worry about with clay tiles. Insects won\u2019t be able to dig into the clay. Another issue you\u2019ll run into with wood, is that it will begin to rot at some point. Clay tiles may crack under heavy pressure, but are impervious to rot. Clay is Good for the Environment. Clay is made using natural materials; not a single chemical is used. That means when its time for you to replace your clay roof, tiles can be broken down and reused on someone else\u2019s roof. So, if you want to go green and reduce your carbon footprint, clay rooftops are absolutely the way to go. They\u2019re one of the most environmentally friendly options available today. Clay Tile Roofs are Low Maintenance. As soon as contractors finish installing your roof tiles, you can pretty much forget they\u2019re there. You may have the occasional clay tile roof repair and inspection every now and again, but that\u2019s it. The tiles don\u2019t leak, they can\u2019t rot, and they won\u2019t experience some of the other problems that most roof types experience. Good for Energy Savings. If you\u2019re tired of energy bills that leave your jaw on the floor, clay tiles will help; clay tiles carry a lot of thermal mass. In simple terms, this means they regulate the temperature throughout your entire home. Since you won\u2019t have to run an HVAC system as often, your energy bill should dip by a large amount. Tiles Won\u2019t Fit on Every Roof. Clay roof tiles aren\u2019t without their drawbacks, however. One of the largest considerations is that they may not fit on your type of roof. Clay tile roof installation is only available on rooftops with considerably sharp slopes. If your roof pitch isn\u2019t at least 4:2 or more, you won\u2019t be able to proceed with installation. They\u2019re Hefty. Even if your roof sits at the right slope for clay tiles to be installed, you may run into problems when it comes to their weight. Clay tiles are heavy. So heavy, in fact, that your roof may need reinforcement before tiles are placed. Consult an expert first to make sure your roof structure can support massive weight. If not, you\u2019ll need further work done, which means more money. They\u2019re Not Easy to Install. Clay roof tile prices are generally more expensive than other types of roofs. The main reason for their high prices is because of complex installation. This isn\u2019t a job you can do yourself. They measure every tile to make sure that they fit and lay them down in a precise pattern. Types of Tile. Clay tiles come in different colors and styles. You\u2019re guaranteed to find something that matches your home. With all the styles available, nobody on your block will have the same exact roof as you. The following are only a few options that you can choose from. Spanish Tiles. If your area sees a lot of rain, the best option for you is Spanish tiles. These tiles are laid down in a way which resemble ocean waves. These \u201cwaves\u201d are good for catching water and sending it away from your roof. Double Roman Tiles. Double Roman tiles look a lot like Spanish ones. The only difference being, that ribs are used in their design. Ribs are easy-to-see and ideal for keeping water away. Pantile. If you want a clay roof and are budgeting, then the pantile style works best for you. They aren\u2019t as heavy as traditional clay tiles, and are laid down in somewhat of an \u2018S\u2019 pattern. They highly resemble ripples when finished. Everything You Need to Know About a Clay Tile Roof. While a clay tile roof doesn\u2019t come without its own set of problems, it has more advantages than disadvantages. They come in several different colors and styles which create a unique look, setting you apart from your neighbors. They\u2019re also durable and can withstand most things that Mother Nature throws at it.

Creating Respite for Rescues. Our friends at the Bucks County SPCA assist animals in need and prevent suffering through rescue, rehoming, cruelty prosecution and community outreach. Animals come to the shelter to find their forever home. One of our favorite projects helps to keep these animals safe, happy and healthy during their time at the shelter. Working with Executive Director Linda Reider, we raised funds to complete the \"Creating Respite for Rescue\" project. The native trees planted on the property provide a healthy environment to shade the rescued animals from the heat of the summer as they rehabilitate and wait to go to their forever homes. Carter van Dyke Associates (CVDA) president and RePlant Bucks Committee Chair Peter Fernandez, was instrumental in getting this project off the ground. Along with Peter, CVDA Landscape Designer Lisa Roman spearheaded this project by donating the time and skills to design a strategic tree canopy to shelter the animal enclosures, as well as developed a tree lined walking path where prospective rescuers, volunteers and staff can exercise and bond with the animals. Our longtime supporter Christine Gale, from Gale Nurseries, performed the installation. Together with ongoing support of the Buck Beautiful community and other community partners such as the Charitable Giving Foundation of Penn Community Bank, we were thrilled to join with the BCSPCA to help protect and enhance the quality of life for the animals at the Upper Bucks shelter site.

Posted on April 1, 2024. Invisalign braces are a popular straightening option for adults and teens. The clear incremental trays gently move teeth into the proper position. Many people mistakenly believe that orthodontic services like Invisalign aligners are strictly for appearance's sake. The truth is that about 81% of respondents reported that the benefits of Invisalign extended way beyond aesthetics. Invisalign can, of course, deliver a great smile, but they also help to improve the health of your teeth. If you are considering Invisalign aligners, there are a few things that you need to know to help you make your decision. Beware of Imposter Braces. Not all clear aligners are created equally. If you want the best results, you must start with the best orthodontic services. Trying to take shortcuts by purchasing \"imposter\" Invisalign online will not get you the results that you need. True Invisalign treatment comes only from a highly trained orthodontist. If you want the best results, do not be fooled by aligner costs that seem too good to be true. Make sure you visit a trusted and experienced provider for a Smile Assessment to ensure you're aware of all your treatment options. Easy Care. The clear Invisalign aligner trays are removable so that you can eat and drink without worry. Caring for the trays is simple- you just rinse them off with warm water. The beauty of this bracing method is that you do not have to struggle to brush or floss around wires. You remove the trays to brush and floss your teeth, as well as eat or drink, then simply put them back in when you are done. Of course, traditional metal braces do not allow you the freedom to take them on and off to care for your teeth or eat and drink, making Invisalign aligners are an excellent and convenient option for adults and teens. Time is On Your Side with Invisalign. A lot of people mistakenly believe that if they need braces, they better be ready to wear them for years. The fact is, thanks to advances in technology, you may only need to wear your trays for about a year. In some cases, where the correction required is minor, you may only need to wear your trays for six months. While each case is different, you likely have less treatment time ahead of you than you think. Your orthodontist is the expert that can give you an accurate time frame for your specific needs.

Posted on August 1, 2024. Patients who visit Precision Orthodontics want a straight, healthy smile. Many of them also want a white smile. Can you whiten your teeth with braces? Can you use whitening strips with braces?. Several products promise you a white smile, from toothpaste to at-home whitening kits to charcoal products. What is the best way to whiten your teeth? Can you whiten teeth with braces, or should you do teeth whitening after braces?. At Precision Orthodontics, we know many patients don't just want a straight smile; they want a straight smile with beautiful white teeth. It's not the best idea to whiten teeth with braces, and we'll explain why. Can You Whiten Your Teeth With Braces? 5 Things to Know. Can I Whiten My Teeth With Braces?. Teeth whitening involves using certain solutions, such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide, to bleach out stains or discolorations. These solutions remove surface stains from the enamel, the hard outer shell of your tooth that protects the living interior. These products work by covering the surface of the tooth. Braces block part of that surface, and the whitening solution can't penetrate the bonding agent used to hold the brackets in place. We know you want whiter teeth, but it's best to wait until after your braces are removed. How To Keep Your Teeth Whiter With Braces. The best way to keep your teeth white with braces is to brush your teeth and floss regularly. You need to brush twice a day, preferably with an electric toothbrush. It can reach around your brackets more easily than a manual toothbrush. You also need to floss at least once a day. It's not easy with braces, but floss threaders can help. Poor hygiene and tooth decay can discolor your teeth. Plaque and tartar buildup can lead to a yellowing of your enamel. Tooth decay can cause your teeth to turn brown or gray where a cavity is forming. If you see this, visit your dentist right away. This could mean a cavity is imminent. Be sure to visit your dentist twice a year for a good cleaning. A lack of good oral hygiene can also cause demineralization of the enamel, which can leave white spots after braces. Why Aren't My Teeth White?. There are many ways your teeth can become discolored. Two common culprits are certain foods and certain drinks. Coffee, tea, fruit juices, red wine and soft drinks can stain teeth. Blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and other fruits can also discolor your teeth. Another huge culprit is tobacco products. Smoking or chewing tobacco can stain your teeth yellow or brown over time. Tobacco products can also cause mouth and throat cancers, as well as lung and other cancers. It's a good idea to break the tobacco habit as soon as possible. Finally, trauma can cause discoloration to your teeth. If you're in an accident or have an injury from sports, the impact to your teeth can bruise or damage the living tissue of the tooth underneath the enamel, causing the enamel to become discolored. You can also end up with discolored teeth because of certain prescription medications. Aging can also discolor a tooth because you lose enamel as you age, and stains accumulate over time. When Should I Whiten My Teeth With Braces?. It's not a good idea because the whitening solution cannot get underneath your brackets. That means you'll have spots on your teeth once your braces come off. It's best to wait until your braces are off before trying teeth whitening solutions. We would recommend holding off using whitening toothpaste or other home products. Make sure you brush and floss regularly and visit your dentist twice a year for proper cleaning. Avoid foods and drinks that can stain your teeth, and stop using tobacco products if you use them. Then, once your braces are off, you'll be ready for teeth whitening after braces. Which Is Best, Professional Or Home Teeth Whitening?. People visit the store and see toothpastes that claim to be whitening toothpastes. They also see home kits that promise to whiten their teeth. They may even see claims that brushing with charcoal will whiten their teeth. Do any of these work? What is the easier way to get whiter teeth? Some do to a certain degree, but none will give you the results that professional tooth whitening will. Some home products may even cause harm or damage if not applied properly. Professional Tooth Whitening. What happens with a professional tooth whitening? You'll start with a professional cleaning from your dentist to remove plaque and tartar buildup so you get the best whitening results. Your dentist will use a special whitening solution with a much higher peroxide concentration than you would find in a home kit. Your dentist will know exactly how long to leave the solution on your teeth without damaging them. Leaving white strips on too long can cause your teeth to be sensitive. It may take more than one session to get the shade of white you want, but professional whitening can achieve this in fewer sessions than you would need to with at-home teeth whitening products. Whitening Toothpaste. Some people wonder if whitening or charcoal toothpastes help. Whitening toothpaste can provide a little tooth whitening, but it's often not much. Charcoal toothpaste can temporarily whiten your teeth but should not be used often. It can damage your teeth and make you ill. Whitening Strips. Whitening strips are a popular at-home method of teeth whitening. Some use a special gel, while others have the gel built into the strip. Whitening strips work better than whitening toothpaste because the active ingredient - either hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide - is more concentrated. When used correctly, whitening strips can whiten teeth a shade or two. The downside is that they may not cover the surfaces of your teeth completely, leaving blotches near the edges. Also, whitening strips can make your teeth sensitive if used too long or too often. Professional whitening is the safest, most reliable way to whiten your teeth. Should I Whiten My Teeth With Braces?. It's not a good idea because the whitening solution cannot get underneath your brackets. That means you'll have spots on your teeth once your braces come off. It's best to wait until your braces are off before trying teeth whitening solutions. We would recommend holding off using whitening toothpaste or other home products. You can work to keep your teeth at the white level they are now so that teeth whitening will be easier later. Make sure you brush and floss regularly and visit your dentist twice a year for proper cleaning. Avoid foods and drinks that can stain your teeth, and stop using tobacco products if you use them. Once your braces are off, professional teeth whitening can add an extra sparkle to your beautiful new smile. Wait until your braces treatment is complete to get the best results for your smile.

A routine exam and cleaning is for all ages and consists of a full mouth series of x-rays, oral cancer screening, teeth and gum evaluations. A simple cleaning is performed as well. Tooth Pain. Tooth pain can have many causes. A bigger cavity may cause pain and may require a root canal. However, sometimes teeth can be very sensitive without the presence of a cavity. The first step is to diagnose the condition and then discuss treatment options. Broken Tooth. A broken tooth can cause pain, difficulty chewing, and can also be a cosmetic issue.

{"company_id": 397823, "page_url": "https://www.advanceddentalcaregrandprairie.com/restorative-dentist", "company_name": "Elsa D Flores DMD", "text": "Restorative & Comprehensive Dentistry in Grand Prairie. We are glad to take care of a wide range of dental needs, from your run-of-the-mill check-ups to composite fillings to comfortable dentures. We're interested in both the health of your mouth and the beauty of your smile!. Preventive Dentistry. Preventive dentistry is one of the main focuses of 's practice philosophy. Focusing on preventive dental care and routine check-ups not only keeps your teeth and gums looking and feeling great (and your breath smelling better), but it can also significantly reduce the amount of money you'll have to spend on dental treatment later in life. Routine Teeth Cleanings & Dental Exams. These regular appointments are recommended every six months. They include an individual consultation and dental exam, professional teeth cleaning, and X-rays (when needed). We will also discuss proper home care and what you can do next to ensure your overall oral health. Custom Nightguards. If you wake up in the morning with a headache or a sore jaw, you may be clenching or grinding your teeth at night, a condition called bruxism. We create custom nightguards that help reduce the effects of teeth grinding and jaw clenching. If you think you may have this condition or you've noticed the wear on your teeth, please let us know. Dr. Flores will take a look and let you know if a nightguard is right for you. Periodontal Health (Gum Health). While we may pay particular attention to our teeth, it's very important that we give our gums attention, too. We are able to diagnose gum disease, provide periodontal treatment, and offer the appropriate follow-up maintenance. Dental Sealants. Dental sealants help protect teeth against decay by filling in the grooves and crevices on a chewing tooth's surface. They work well for children who might have more trouble thoroughly brushing their back teeth. Additional Preventive Dental Services. Athletic Mouthguards. Fluoride Treatments. Halitosis Treatment. Oral Cancer Screenings. Restorative Dentistry. If you have a dental problem, we are here to find you a solution. Our many restorative dental services can provide you with relief and get you back to a healthy, full smile. Tooth-Colored Fillings. Composite fillings can be adhesively held in place or \"bonded,\" which allows for more conservative preparations where less healthy tooth structure is removed. This often results in smaller fillings than that of amalgam (silver) fillings. The tooth-colored material is cured with a special light and the surface is shaped and polished to match the tooth, rendering the final restoration virtually undetectable to the eye and very natural looking. Dental Crowns. Dental crowns strengthen damaged teeth and can improve the appearance of a discolored or misshaped tooth. Our practice offers a variety of dental crowns to meet your needs, including bruxer crowns, e-max crowns, and porcelain metal crowns. We are happy to discuss your needs to find the option right for you. Dental Bridges. If you are dealing with a gap from one or more missing teeth, we may suggest getting a dental bridge. A dental bridge stays in place by being fixed to teeth or implants on either side of the space. We'll make sure your dental bridge matches the look of your natural teeth and fits well. Dental Implants. Many people who are missing teeth struggle with ill-fitting, uncomfortable dentures or retainers with false teeth. If you know what this feels like and are ready for a solution, Dr. Flores has one for you!Dental implants are effective in stabilizing dentures to fit better, feel better, look better, and even smell better (because they prevent food from getting trapped underneath). Implants are also a wonderful option for single-tooth replacements. Ask us about giving your smile a second chance with implant dentistry. Complete Denture Solutions. Dr. Flores has extensive experience helping patients find just the right dentures. Unlike other offices where you\u2019ll need to wait weeks for your dentures, we can, in many cases, set you up with dentures the same day as your visit!. We offer a number of denture solutions. Complete dentures or full dentures are great for people who are missing most or all of their teeth in the upper and/or lower arch. Removable partial dentures can serve as a replacement for one or multiple missing teeth. Partial dentures are similar to complete dentures, but they fit around your remaining natural teeth. Dentures can also be supported by dental implants to provide additional stability and strength. Immediate dentures are provided to patients the same day they have had teeth extracted. They allow patients to still leave the office with an attractive smile, and they help the healing process. We\u2019ll work with you to find a denture solution that makes sense for you!. Cosmetic Dentistry. From minor tooth adjustments to dramatic makeovers, our cosmetic dentistry services can enhance your smile. Snap-On Smile\u00ae. Snap-On Smile\u00ae is an inexpensive alternative to permanent cosmetic dental treatments, such as porcelain veneers. The appliance literally snaps on without the need for adhesives or any invasive procedures at all. Snap-On Smile appliances are made of a special resin, which is strong yet flexible, resistant to stains, and polishes well for a sleek and attractive finish. This material is formed into thin, removable smile appliances that come in 18 different smile designs and in 23 color shades. The design and shade chosen by you and your dentist is customized to fit your mouth, using upper and lower impressions of your mouth. Professional Teeth Whitening. In addition to giving you the benefit of a cleaner-looking and more attractive smile, whiter teeth can also enhance your confidence and self-esteem. Whitening can also lead to healthier teeth because when your teeth look better, you tend to take better care of them to keep them looking terrific. We have two teeth whitening options available:custom trays and one-visit whitening. The Lumineers\u00ae Veneers System. Lumineers\u00ae are a comfortable, conservative way to a beautiful smile!In as few as two or three appointments, Dr. Flores can create the smile of your dream - a smile that will radiate confidence and joy. With this system, we can apply the thin, custom-made, permanent veneers to the front side of your teeth without extensive preparation, and in most cases, without injections. No kidding!. Oral Surgery. Getting oral surgery does not have to be scary. In fact, it can significantly alleviate your pain and prevent serious damage from occurring!At Advanced Dental Care, you can count on our experienced, gentle staff to perform the procedure in a calm, stress-free environment. We're here to answer any questions you might have and make sure you feel safe. Tooth Extractions. Root Canal Therapy (Endodontics). Wisdom Teeth Removal. Sedation Dentistry. Dental anxiety is not unusual, and people of any age can experience such feelings. We practice sedation dentistry, so you can receive the treatment you desire in a manner that's most comfortable to you. Please share your feelings and concerns with us, so we can accommodate you and make your dental visits as anxiety- and pain-free as we can. Nitrous Oxide (Laughing Gas). Nitrous oxide (laughing gas) is a safe, commonly used sedation technique that can help you relax in the dental chair. When nitrous oxide is administered, you'll quickly experience a warm feeling of well-being. This effect goes away just minutes after we stop the treatment so you'll be able to leave our office feeling back to normal. Oral Conscious Sedation. Oral sedation is a popular sedation technique, as you just have to take a prescribed medication shortly before your appointment. Oral conscious sedation has helped many people who are afraid of the dentist get the dental care they need. Emergency Dental Care. If you have a serious dental concern, we strongly advise you to call us as soon as possible. That way we can let you know the next steps you need to take to look after your injury or pain and whether or not you need to come in for treatment immediately. Many times, acting quickly is the determining factor in whether or not your tooth can be saved. We devote a portion of our workday to dental emergencies, so you won't have to wait in pain to see Dr. Flores and get the relief you need.", "gpt_labels": ["description.supplementary_but_not_general", "description.product"], "gpt_explanation": "\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **Contains supplementary information about the company but no general description**: True.

Each auction will have information regarding where the items are located, the name and telephone number of the contact person, and, if applicable, a scheduled preview time. If there is a specified preview time, you may preview auction items only during this time, no exceptions. Check the specific auction terms and listings to see if shipping is available on that auction. Payment is expected as soon as the auction closes.
